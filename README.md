# Simple API Fetch Practice 🚀

This project is a small practice demo where I fetch data from  
**JSONPlaceholder API** and render it dynamically on the page using JavaScript.  
It's my **first experience working with APIs**, and I’m pretty excited about it! ✨

If you think the project could be improved, feel free to jump in —  
I’d love any contributions, feedback, or refactoring ideas.  
Let’s build something better together. 🤝💡
